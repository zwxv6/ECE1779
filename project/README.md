This project aims to tackle the spread of fake news by developing a cloud-based natural language processing (NLP) classifier to differentiate between true and fake news. Utilizing advanced NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms, the classifier will analyze news content and categorize it as genuine or counterfeit. The project involves data collection, model training, and deployment as a scalable cloud service. Challenges include data quality, news source biases, and evolving misinformation tactics. The effectiveness will be measured by the classifier's accuracy in combating fake news and enhancing information reliability. The project contributes to the research field by exploring the implementation and performance of NLP technology in cloud environments.
